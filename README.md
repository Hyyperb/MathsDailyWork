# MathsDailyWork
A repository containing python files releted to my maths daily homework

Principles kept in mind while creating this:

1) If it works, don't touch it

2) Optimization? no, we don't need it here

3) Tried (my) best to keep code clean

4) No copypasta from stackoverflow, keep it OC

5) Write readme file instead of fixing critical bugs

6) One line code is alright, we won't touch that part again

7) Spend 1 hour to automate a 5 minute task
